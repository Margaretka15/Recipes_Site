# My-Recipes-Site

This is a web page I created as a final project for the Hypertext languages and web page design course. The objectives of the project were:

- providing the ability to modify the content of the page using a form
- adding the content dynamically
- communication with a database
- simple sign-up/sign-in mechanism
- full responsiveness
